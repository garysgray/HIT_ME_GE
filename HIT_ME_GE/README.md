# HTML5 Web Game Engine (Work-in-Progress)

This is my attempt at building a **simple yet strong HTML5 web game engine**.  
It’s not meant to compete with something huge like Unity, but rather to provide a **lean, flexible foundation** for making **decent prototypes** that can quickly go up on the web.  

I see this as a **major building block** toward my bigger goal:  
a website hosting **many small web games**, all powered by this engine.

## Purpose

- **For learning** → I’m just a *mediocre game coder* (for now!) who’s learning to level up using ChatGPT as a guide.  
- **For building** → I’ve already created a few small games with this mindset: that each game is also a step in designing an engine.  
- **For expanding** → I stripped out raw gameplay code and started focusing on **engine features** that can grow as I make more games.  

This engine is meant to be:
- **Simple** → Easy to read, tweak, and extend.  
- **Strong** → Reliable enough to serve as a foundation for multiple games.  
- **Reusable** → A system others can also use for their own experiments.

## Vision

- A **lightweight HTML5 engine** for 2D web games.  
- A **launchpad for prototypes** you can run directly in the browser.  
- A **learning project** that evolves as I add features game by game.  
- Eventually, a **shared system** that makes it easier to build and publish small games online.  

---

## Features (Current & Planned)

-  Core game loop (update + render)  
-  Input handling (keyboard, mouse — expanding later)  
-  Asset management (images, sounds, etc.)  
-  Modular structure for code reusability  
-  Expandable components (entities, physics, UI, etc.)

## Why This Matters

I’ve made some games before, but always with an eye on the **engine beneath the gameplay**.  
Now I’m stripping it down, making it cleaner, and focusing on building tools I — and others — can use to **go beyond just one-off games**.  

This is a **step toward becoming more than mediocre**:  
learning by doing, and leaving behind a reusable system along the way.

## Status

 **Work in Progress** 
This is an evolving project. The core works, but I’m still experimenting, adding, and refining.  
Expect things to change as I learn and build.

## Closing Note

This may not be **Unity**, but it’s my engine.  
It’s a **foundation**, a **learning tool**, and hopefully a **useful little engine** for anyone else who wants to get simple web games running fast.
